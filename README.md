# Project EOfTours para Maria

What does E Of Tours stand for? Ask Maria

What got Maria started on this? Ask Maria

- Google Auth (Skeleton.js & auth.js)
- Socket Infrastructure (client-socket.js & server-socket.js)
- User Model (auth.js & user.js)

## Socket stuff

<!-- ask Maria if we need server client communication -> maybe? -->

- If you're not using realtime updating or don't need server->client communication, you can remove socket entirely! (server-socket.js, client-socket.js, and anything that imports them)
<!-- already set it up though -->

## regularly
- `npx webpack`
- to start server `npm start`
- to start local build `npm run hotloader`
